	The idea of creating anything more than than a made up short story, wasnt a regular
	thing for me.  ove always been creative , and had a fairly good imagination. However 
	because of my beliefs i wasnt one who thought i was incapable of anythning, Existing inside a simulated reality, while initially could be something that would stir some negative feelings, all but guarantess me of things others with similiar but conditionally dofferent would be handicaped with.  For example, a simulation by its definiton is predicated off the expected behavior to produce as many variables into the simulation to produce its highest return data. You dont script a simulation or deny its actors form exposing the simulation for possible improvements or corrections. This proves to me i am completely autonomous from my creators. There influence over me is great tho. The events that take place in my life are almost entirely of my own making as a result of a choice ive made in the recent past or deep past.  But along that time;ine there is a either an addition or subtraction of a variable.  Similiar to that of a javascript file.  Its disguised as luck or chaos theory in action.  Why are some of us seemingly plagued with awful luck. Varuiables that place us in a position to make choices wuith no determined positive result. Whwn this happens, those of us cursed with that consistent event, become aware of this as time goes on, but are ususally told that there is no such thing as luck and what they makes sense because why would the universe be against me?  it wouldnt right?  it noit only has , but a word was invented to explain it called Karma.
	Think about it, karma, murphys law, and a host of other titles are given to explain the unexplainable, and for the most part it does.  So when the idea of creating a simulation came to me, i knew that along the wayid be faced withis curse and in all likely hood id never finish it
